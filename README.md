## 1st round questions front end developer at Yandex.

I solved questions 5 and 4, because they actually made sense as opposed to the others...

Supposedly questions are supposed to get harder i.e. question 1 is the easiest vs question 5 is the hardest. Not the case...

I solved question 5 partially 60% 
I solved question 4 completely 100%
I swear I solved question 3 because it worked in the browser...
Question 2 seems simple, just a lot of places where things can go wrong
Question 1 did not make much sense

I need to review graph algorithms..

That was hard.
